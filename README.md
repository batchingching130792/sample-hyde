## **[The distant future…]**

 Invaders from another world attack without warning, unleashing a new type of threat: weapons known as “machine lifeforms.” In the face of this insurmountable threat, mankind is driven from Earth and takes refuge on the Moon.

 The Council of Humanity organizes a resistance of android soldiers in an effort to take back their planet. To break the deadlock, the Resistance deploys a new unit of android infantry: YoRHa .

 In the forsaken wasteland below, the war between the machines and the androids rages on. A war that is soon to unveil the long-forgotten truth of this world...

## Char[a]cters

 ![2B YoRHa No. 2, Type B](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nierautomata-1280-1-1488398963732_1280w.jpg?fit=750%2C422&strip=all)
                                                                                                                        
**2B (YoRHa No. 2, Type B)**

A blade…with a quiet volition.<br />

An all-purpose battle android deployed as a member of the automated infantry squad, YoRHa. She is equipped with a sword for close-quarters combat, and can attack from range using the “Pod” tactical support system. Members of YoRHa forgo names and are referred to only by their codes. Though regulations forbid them from expressing emotions, each model has its own distinguishing personality, and 2B is comparatively cool, calm, and collected.<br />

 ![9S (YoRHa No. 9, Type S](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/9S.jpg)

 **9S (YoRHa No. 9, Type S)**

A soul…and an ephemeral kindness.<br />

Though he has the ability to attack, this YoRHa android specializes in research missions and excels in collecting information, mainly by hacking. Within YoRHa, 9S is comparatively varied in his emotional expressions and has a kind personality.<br />


<br />
<br />
<br />



![A2 (YoRHa Type A, No. 2](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/A2-1.jpg)

**A2 (YoRHa Type A, No. 2)**

 A vortex...of the past and hatred.
 
The Type A is a YoRHa prototype model that is no longer in use. She specilizes in close-range attacks. She was operated in trial basis in the process of developing official models such as 2B and 9S. Personality-wise, she has little to say and always acts independently.

<br />

![Pod 042 and Pod 153](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Pod_SS_01-1200x675.jpg)





**Pod 042 and Pod 153**

These support units are part of every YoRHa soldier's standard equipment. They come installed with various weapons used for long-range combat, and can also aid their owners in traversal. They can display messages coming in from the Command, and they are also capable of exchanging information among themselves to devise strategies. 2B is followed by Pod 042, while 9S is accompanied by Pod 153.

![Commander](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Commander_SS_01-1200x675.jpg)

**Commander**

The leader of the "Bunker," a miilitary base orbiting Earth. She is in charge of all YoRHa units. Her position demands her to be calm and collected at all times, but she seems to worry for the personal safety of 2B and 9S. She also appears to have some kind of history with YoRHa prototype moodel A2.

![Operator 60 and Operator 210](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Operator_SS_01.jpg)


**Operator 60 and Operator 210**

Two communications operators permanently stationed at the Bunker.
They are mainly in charge of analyzing intel, and relaying orders to the YoRHa units on the planet’s surface. They have fairly different personalities, with 6O, who’s in charge of 2B, being relatively bright and cheerful, whereas 21O, in charge of 9S, is always cool and composed

![Adam and Eve](https://www.platinumgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AdamEve_SS_01.jpg)

**Adam**

A mysterious young man.<br />
He wears glasses and is extremely intelligent. He has a generally calm personality, but does not shy away from excessive force in order to attain his goals.

<br />

**Eve**

Adam’s younger twin.<br />
Contrary to Adam, Eve is short-tempered and doesn’t like thinking too much. His brother means the world to him.<br />
